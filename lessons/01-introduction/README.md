# Lesson 1: Introduction to the MERN Stack

Welcome to the first lesson! In this lesson, we will introduce the MERN stack and its components.

## What is the MERN Stack?

MERN is a popular JavaScript stack for building full-stack web applications. It consists of four technologies:

*   **MongoDB:** A NoSQL database for storing application data.
*   **Express.js:** A web application framework for Node.js, used for building the backend API.
*   **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
*   **Node.js:** A JavaScript runtime environment for running the backend server.

## In this lesson, you will learn:

*   The role of each component in the MERN stack.
*   The benefits of using the MERN stack for web development.
*   How the client and server interact in a MERN application.
